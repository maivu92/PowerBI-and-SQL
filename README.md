## Analytics Questions
Before we begin, Let’s first identify and answer some business questions related to our data:
1. Number of revenue over the past several years?
2. Which months have the most revenue?
3. Which country has the most revenue?
4. What types of products do customers order the most?
5. Top 5 best selling products?
6. Which territory has the most revenue?
